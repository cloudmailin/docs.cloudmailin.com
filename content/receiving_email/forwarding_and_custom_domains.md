# Using your own domain
There are two options available to receive email at your own domain. Email
forwarding uses your existing provider to redirect certain email address, custom
domains allows you to receive all the email at a given domain.

| Type                                                   | Method                                              | Best For     |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| [Custom Domains](/receiving_email/using-your-own-domain/)     | Uses CloudMailin's servers for your domain's email. | Receive all email for a given domain *@yourdomain.com (or wildcard domain *@*.yourdomain.com). |
| [Email Forwarding](/receiving_email/email_forwarding/) | Redirect email from your current provider.          | A simple solution to receive email at a single or few email addresses. |

> We recommend using [Custom Domains](/receiving_email/using-your-own-domain/)
> if you can as we cannot control the forwarding from your existing provider.
