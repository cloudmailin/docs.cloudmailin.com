# Email Forwarding

Email forwarding allows you to receive CloudMailin email to your own domain name such as example@yourdomain.com. Forwarding can be set up at your domain registrar or from your existing email provider such as Google Mail.

Using email forwarding you can forward a single or multiple email addresses to your CloudMailin email address.

**Note:** _When email forwarding is in place CloudMailin has no control over when the provider will forward the message. It can result in delays in delivery that are beyond our control._

## Setting up Email Forwarding

### Google Mail

  1. Log into your google account.
  2. Follow the link to `Forwarding and POP/IMAP`.
  3. Click the `Add a forwarding address` button.
  4. Enter your CloudMailin email address and click next.
  5. An email will be sent to your CloudMailin address for verification. To view the email that's sent either view your applications logs or you can use the [debugger](/receiving_email/localhost_debugger/) (set the debugger as the address target and click resend verification email).
  6. Once the email is verified select the email address within the drop-down menu.
  7. Now any email sent to this email should automatically be forwarded onto your CloudMailin address.

This guide will contain examples to help demonstrate setting up email forwarding on different hosts. To contribute to the document please contact us or edit it yourself on github.
