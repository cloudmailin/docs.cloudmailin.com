title: Full Email Storage / Backup in AWS S3, Azure, or Google Storage
description:
  CloudMailin allows you to store or backup an entire email in
  either EML format or fully parsed JSON. The Email is stored within an AWS S3
  bucket, Azure Blob Storage or Google Cloud Storage and delivered to your
  webhook. This page covers how to get setup.

# Full Email Storage / Backup API for AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob

CloudMailin allows you to receive any volume of email over HTTP via HTTP POST
Webhook. For some time it has been possible to offload the sending of email
attachments to Cloud Storage such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3, Google Cloud
Platform Storage or Azure Blob Storage.

It's also possible to send the entire email to CloudStorage, opening up new
possibilities for your HTTP server to process inbound emails.

You can send the full email to:

* [Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3]
* [Microsoft Azure Blob Storage]
* [Google Cloud Platform Cloud Storage]

## Why send email directly to Cloud Storage?

Sending your full email, rather than just the email attachments to AWS S3,
Google Cloud Storage or Azure Blob Storage opens new possibilities for receiving
inbound emails via Webhook. You could process the email asynchronously, use the
system as a backup or work more effectively with serverless functions for
example.

### Email storage formats

There are two formats available for full email storage raw and parsed JSON:

| Format | Description                                          |
|--------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `RAW`  | The original, unparsed email with headers and body.
| `JSON` | A fully parsed email in JSON format. This format is the same as the [JSON format] sent to your Webhook.

## Send the full email to AWS S3

Once you have enabled the feature you setup the Full Message storage in a very
similar way to setting up attachment storage.

### Grant CloudMailin permission send email to your AWS S3 Bucket

There are several ways that you can grant permission for CloudMailin to create
files in your S3 Bucket. The simplest is to use the AWS website.

1. Go to the AWS Management Console
   [https://console.aws.amazon.com](https://console.aws.amazon.com) and Sign in.
2. Click on the S3 Tab, then select your bucket (or create a new one)
    ![The S3 Tab](/assets/images/s3/list-aws-services-s3.png)
3. Click on permissions the button

4. Scroll down to the Access control list (ACL) panel
    ![The S3 Permissions ACL](/assets/images/s3/s3-permissions-acl.png)
5. Click `Edit` and then `Add grantee`
    ![The S3 Permissions
    Tab](/assets/images/s3/add-canonical-id.png)
6. In the `grantee` field from above, paste the CloudMailin Canonical ID,
    choose `write` and then save

> AWS Canonical ID: `83fec836f8a832fae9c46e100739b635be3b3636d14887e1c7616e2dba1a88c0`

You should now have granted CloudMailin permission to add files to your S3
bucket. You can now [Setup CloudMailin] to receive the emails in it's Webhook.

## Send the full email to Azure Blob Storage

It's possible to configure CloudMailin to send attachments directly to Azure
storage.

You'll need to give us your storage credentials so that we can create a file
within your storage account.

In order to use Azure file storage [contact us].

## Send the full email to Google Cloud Storage

It's possible to configure CloudMailin to send attachments directly to Google
Cloud storage. This helps reduce the burden on your application and improves
response times.

You'll need to give us your storage credentials so that we can create a file
within your storage account.

In order to use Google Cloud file storage [contact us].

## Setup CloudMailin to Send Emails to Cloud Storage

Now that you've added the permission to upload emails head to CloudMailin and
enable the feature.

1. Log into your [Address Dashboard] and choose the address you wish to manage.
2. Select `Add full message storage`.
3. Enter your AWS S3 bucket name and an optional path prefix to place before
  each file name (in the format `bucket_name/path_prefix`). You'll also need
  to add your S3 bucket region.
4. You will need to select the permission to apply to files when they are
  created. We recommend using `Bucket owner full control` here.
5. Finally, you'll need to select the [Format].

Now when your emails are received you'll still get the regular Webhook but your
HTTP POST will also include the `store_url` parameter in the `envelope`. For
example the JSON format will look like the following:

```jsonc
"envelope": {
  "to": "to@example.com",
  "from": "from@example.com",
  "helo_domain": "localhost",
  // ...
  "store_url": "https://example.s3.amazonaws.com/2021_12_01_00_00_00_a8ed6a3f7aeb93ce726b9dd2dea9eb53.eml"
}
```

For more detail relating to the store_url see the
[HTTP Post Formats](/http_post_formats/) documentation.
