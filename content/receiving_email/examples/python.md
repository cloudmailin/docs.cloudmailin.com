# Receiving Email with Python

## Django

[Jeremy Carbaugh](https://github.com/jcarbaugh) at Sunlight Foundation constructed a Django client for CloudMailin's original format so that you can use CloudMailin to receive email easily from within your Django Apps.

The code and usage examples are up on [Github](https://github.com/CloudMailin/django-cloudmailin). We suggest you take a look and try it out for yourself!
