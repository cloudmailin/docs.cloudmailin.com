# Receiving Email with PHP and Laravel

It's possible to receive email in PHP by running a mail server and executing a PHP script with
the email passed to STDIN. With [CloudMailin] you don't need to do any of that, your email
is delivered to your application over HTTP(S).

* [Receiving Email in PHP](#plain-php)
* [Receiving Email in Laravel](#receiving-email-in-laravel)

> Additional information about the format of the HTTP POST sent by CloudMailin can be found in the
  <%= link_to_item('/http_post_formats/') %> documentation.
  There are also some [Postman Examples](<%= url_to_item('/http_post_formats/') %>#postman).

### Receiving Email via HTTP POST
When receiving mail in PHP we recommend using our `Normalized Multipart` format.
In this format your email will be delivered by HTTP POST as `multipart/form-data` content.
This means that most of the content will be accessible from the `$_POST` variable. However, attachments will be in the `$_FILES` variable as an upload.

#### Response Type
Firstly we're going to set a content type as `text/plain`. With the content type set to plain text CloudMailin will record any error messages returned when the HTTP status is not 2xx
(<%= link_to_item('/receiving_email/http_status_codes/') %>).

```php
<?php
  // Setting content-type: text/plain will allow CloudMailin to store this response if it's an error
  header("Content-type: text/plain");
?>
```

## Plain PHP

### The Envelope (SMTP Transaction)

The SMTP transaction itself receives a recipient (`to`) and a mail (`from`) command.
This allows the server to route the email.
We also retain some other information such as the remote server IP and encryption (TLS) status.

> Often you don't want the to/from address in the envelope (SMTP) if your email is being forwarded.
> The intended information is normally available in the headers and is often different and
> preferable. Feel free to [contact us] if you need help deciding which to use.

```php
<?php
  // We recommend you use the normalized multipart format with PHP
  echo("Envelope:\n");
  print_r($_POST['envelope']);
?>
```

We can implement a simple check to accept or reject the email based on the SMTP transaction's
`RCPT TO` like the following:

```php
  $to = $_POST['envelope']['to'];
  if ($to == 'allowed@example.com'){
    http_response_code(201);
    echo("success\n");
  }else{
    http_response_code(403);
    echo("user not allowed here\n");
  }
?>
```

Note that the CloudMailin server will respond to the SMTP sending server as if the mailbox does not
exist if we return 403 (<%= link_to_item('/receiving_email/http_status_codes/') %>).

### The Headers

All of the headers can be found in the `headers` parameter.

```php
<?php
  echo("Headers:\n");
  print_r($_POST['headers']);
?>
```
```output
Array
(
    [received] => by mail-qv1-f65.google.com with SMTP id p7so20148692qvl.4        for <postman@example.net>; Wed, 08 Jul 2020 02:45:03 -0700
    [date] => Wed, 08 Jul 2020 10:44:51 +0100
    [from] => Test User <test@example.com>
    [to] => postman@example.net
    [message_id] => <CALazKR8Zr8Lsv+SUAeuaL-vrhWSCK36TRU8=7HjsenxwaP9ZbA@mail.gmail.com>
    [subject] => Test Email
    ...
)
```

Note that if there are multiple values for the same header then this can be an array of strings not
just a string.

### Plain Content

The plain part of the email is in the `plain` parameter. Note that not all emails will have a plain
part, we recommend falling back to the `html` parameter just in case here.

```php
<?php
  echo("Plain:\n");
  echo($_POST['plain']."\n");
?>
```

### HTML Content

The HTML part of the email is in the `html` parameter. Note that not all emails will have an HTML
part, we recommend falling back to the `plain` parameter just in case here, as above.

```php
<?php
  echo("HTML:\n");
  echo($_POST['html']."\n");
?>
```

### Attachments

In the multipart format, attachments are sent over as `$_FILES['attachments']`. This is an array
of attachments so the output will be in the form `$_FILES['attachments']['name'][0]` for example.
More details about attachment formats can be found in the
<%= link_to_item('http_post_formats/multipart_normalized/') %> section:

```php
<?php
  echo("Attachments:\n");
  print_r($_FILES["attachments"]);
?>
```
```output
Attachments:
Array
(
    [name] => Array
        (
            [0] => Logo.png
        )

    [type] => Array
        (
            [0] => image/png
        )

    [tmp_name] => Array
        (
            [0] => /tmp/phprXSsmp
        )

    [error] => Array
        (
            [0] => 0
        )

    [size] => Array
        (
            [0] => 68731
        )

)
```

If the attachments are being sent to an [Attachment Store] instead of your server directly then
the attachments' field will be an array of attachments in the `$_POST['attachments']` variable.

More details can be found in the <%= link_to_item('http_post_formats/multipart_normalized/') %>
documentation.

Now that we're done creating our code, you can take a look at the full example or
head over to the [summary](#summary).

### The Full Example

The full example we've been working on can be found below:

```php
<?php
  // Setting content-type: text/plain will allow CloudMailin
  // to store this response if it's an error
  header("Content-type: text/plain");

  $to = $_POST['envelope']['to'];
  if ($to == 'allowed@example.com'){
    http_response_code(201);
    echo("success\n");
  }else{
    http_response_code(403);
    echo("user not allowed here\n");
  }

  echo("Envelope:\n");
  print_r($_POST['envelope']);

  echo("Headers:\n");
  print_r($_POST['headers']);

  echo("Plain:\n");
  echo($_POST['plain']."\n");

  echo("HTML:\n");
  echo($_POST['html']."\n");

  echo("Attachments:\n");
  print_r($_FILES["attachments"]);
?>
```

We that we're done creating our code, you can now head over to the [summary](#summary).

## Receiving Email in Laravel

Receiving mail in Laravel is also straight forward. Again we recommend using the
`Normalized Multipart` format for Laravel to receive email.

We're going to start by creating a single action controller, but you're free to use one of your
regular controllers if it makes more sense:

```shell
php artisan make:controller IncomingMail --invokable
```

That creates the controller so we'll register the route:

```php
use App\Http\Controllers\IncomingMail;

Route::post('/incoming_mail', IncomingMail::class);
```

CloudMailin will send a HTTP POST with the email content so we'll register the controller as a POST.

### The controller

Now that we've setup our route it's time to add some code to the controller.
In this example we're going to access the envelope TO address
(the email from the SMTP transaction) and get hold of the first attachment:


```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;

class IncomingMail extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Handle the incoming request.
     *
     * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
     * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response
     */
    public function __invoke(Request $request)
    {
        $to = $request->input('envelope.to');
        Log::info($to);

        if ($to != "to@example.net"){
            return response("To address not expected", 422)
                ->header('content-type', 'text/plain');
        }

        $file = $request->file('attachments')[0];
        Log::info($file);

        return "Thanks!";
    }
}

```

If the `envelope.to` email doesn't match then we'll return a 422 error with a
plain content type. As we mentioned in the [Response Type](#response-type)
section, if we return a plain response for a 4xx status code then CloudMailin
will store the response to help you debug.

In this controller we only took a few parameters.
All of the available parameters can be found in
the <%= link_to_item('http_post_formats/multipart_normalized/') %>
documentation.

#### Preventing CSRF errors

Because CloudMailin's post will be stateless, and we recommend you use
[Basic Auth](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/authentication#stateless-http-basic-authentication)
and HTTPS to protect your endpoint, we can disable CSRF for this route.
This allows us to prevent the `419 Page Expired` status code occuring when
the HTTP POST is sent.

To solve this we'll disable CSRF Verification just for this action
in `App\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken`:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken as Middleware;

class VerifyCsrfToken extends Middleware
{
    /**
     * The URIs that should be excluded from CSRF verification.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $except = [
        '/incoming_mail'
    ];
}
```
